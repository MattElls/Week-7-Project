How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

In my experience of writing code not only for this project I like to think that there is a draft to perfection.  I think about update version x.x.x.x;  which is how I think in my code I was able ot make the basis of the code to be capable of being added to or edited.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

From some experience working in real world applications I was given the requirements and designed based on their requirements.  The specifications of this project were similar to what I have done before which has allowed me to make the code that I learned how to make in this class.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

I like to say that computer scientists are mainly software developers, the backbone to the cmoputers that we use.  They make computers smarter and easier for the end user.  Sometimes the end user has specific requirements that they want for software to do which is where a computer scientist would make apps that function as the end user wants.  The work on this app would make the customer use the databse tht stores their informaitno and they can add and take away the information in a much easier to use GUI than a line by line script.
